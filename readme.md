# Assignment Time

## This userscript adds up the time elapsed on each problem, to get your total assignment time.

## Installation Guide
* Have a userscript extension installed. I use [TamperMonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), although you may prefer a different extension.
* Go to [totTime.user.js](https://github.com/eliskol/p-assignment-time/blob/main/totTime.user.js)
* Click on the button that says "Raw".
* An installation window should open.
* Install the userscript.
